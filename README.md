Meme Economy is a Chrome extension which lets you invest in the Reddit listings. Just browse Reddit, invest in posts that you think will make it big. Later on, you can cash in on your investments and become the one true meme master.

## How we built it

Meme Economy is built in two parts: a Chrome extension front end, and a C# database. The extension handles user input while the back-end handles all the heavy lifting like data manipulation and calculations. The two halves communicate using a self-built RESTful API. 

## Challenges we ran into
Inter-computer communication was difficult. We faced problems with Windows Firewall, HTTPS certificates, and synchronization. 
Anchu faced challenges with making the Chrome extension and GUI.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Injecting new elements into a Reddit page. 
* Creating our own unique formulas for calculating rate of change and meme prices.
* Designing our own user interface with NO third party JavaScript libraries.

## What we learned
* Chrome extension development
* JavaScript
* RESTful API

## What's next for Meme Economy
We both would like the work on Meme Economy after HackBU. If people respond well, we will work harder on it to make it releasable. The framework for multiplayer is there, but needs some finishing touches in order for it to be functional. We hope we can make Meme Economy into a public application for many people to use.
